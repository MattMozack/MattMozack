		<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>I will be graduating in December of 2020 from the Illinois Institute of Technology with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. Through my studies I have completed courses centering around database management, systems programming, data structures, computer architecture, and algorithmic analysis.</p>

		<div id="Experience">
		<h2>Experience</h2>
			<p>I also have real world experience as a programming and information technology intern at Harper College. During this time, I developed an understanding of how to take a project from an idea to design, creation, and testing, followed by evaluation, production and analysis. I am also currently the Chairman of the Board of Directors for a charitable organization, which is helping me to grow and strengthen my management and leadership skills. I have also held positions that centered around support and customer satisfaction through which I have learned the proper way to interact effectively and politely with clients.</p>
